Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
       This application was for inventory. This inventory application was to have a full grid of items displaying a clear view to scroll through. It also has on the login page a chance to either create a login or use your previous credentials. Once logged in notifications become available for updates on stock levels, and SMS notifications between the device messaged and the device being used. It was designed to address and help warehouse workers.  

What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?
          Buttons were necessary as well as scrolling. When editing the application adding color and fast-paced options helps keep the users in mind. 

How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those techniques or strategies be applied in the future?
          I made a fake interview process as if I were the warehouse worker and needed some adjustments for work on the device. Creating questions like "How much time would I have to be on this device between work?" and the answer be not so long. In the future, I hope to host user interviews besides doing it the old-fashioned way.

How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important, and what did it reveal?
          I ran the code. Which helps locate errors and mistakes. 

Consider the full app design and development process from initial planning to finalization. Where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
                  Nowhere was really a challenge. 

In what specific component of your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?

                   THe designing part is my favorite as I know much about user and implementing their needs. Yet I wasn't vary familiar with this application and it took some getting used to.
